    Embed the game at top

    put links to learn unity with a few videos embeded

    link to github with well explained code
    embed a video about how to access it and how to copy and edit it

    list of links with information about the subject
    links to google docs page open to anytone to colaborate on
    embed pages or pictures of pages with information about the mechanics with springs and angles

    vision statement
    thinkgs to include like social, ptech, etc
    how bringing more ppl to understand will help so make tutorials and explanations for what you add

	TODO:
	Gather basic Unity videos
	Github Unity Video
	Upload project to Github
	Format site a little better
	Gather some chem videos
	make words that remind you of unity operations with brief descriptions
	put them in to quizlet and the app

	text mariely landlord
	text travis
    order caffine
    

    can be like portall going through caverns with puzzels
    there can also be a portal thrower
    and in in game phone with an app that can go on a real phone on the same database
    as you go through there are videos playing about histroy of these things
    videos that show principles and you get the thing you need after you watch it, you need the video info as a hint also
    then use that same thing a lot after not just for one area
    start in your home area with trees and waterfall and a cabin
    there is a training area thre with a memory training thing, with a portal to a loc area and all the other ways
    you can level up in the memory thing and it will help you with the game, levels you cant get past without a good one and high level
    at the end you get to be part of a thing with community made puzzels and a big central area with other people in it doing stuff
    if it works well can expand to other topics as well like math, biology, history

                    A hands on experience of chemical reactions can give an intuitive understanding that just reading about it can't. 
                    It can be made as fun as any video game with competitions, puzzels (like in portal), fps elements, and skill progress.
                    Making chemistry enjoyable can change it from a chore to an enjoyable pass time.
                    If people understand it more people will create things that everyone can benifit from.

                    The current version uses the gravity equation to apply a force based on the radius between them. This is obviously not accurate so the first step is to fix this.
                    Molecular Mechanics set up a simple algebraic expression for the total energy of a compound and a prediction of how it would act.

                    We can hold the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in variables, as well as any other number we might need to hold. 
                    We can get the distance between each atom and we can apply forces on each atom. 
                    What we need is a formula that can take these inputs and output the magnatude and direction of the force.
                    There is an embed google docs page with below with links to resources that might have a solution to this.
